## Serverless E-commerce Catalog on AWS

![Architecture](https://github.com/epsagon/serverless-catalog-shop/blob/master/architecture.png)

This repository documents a developing of a serverless e-commerce catalog on AWS. Below are the key steps I followed in the process:

## 1. Initial Setup with Cloud9 and EC2 Instance Creation

I established a development environment using Cloud9, simplifying the configuration of both the front-end and back-end in the AWS console.

## 2. Hosting on S3

The website was hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring reliable delivery of static content.

## 3. Lambda Implementation with API Gateway

Client interaction with the serverless e-commerce website was achieved through Lambda functions, triggered by the API Gateway in response to user actions.

## 4. Product Management in DynamoDB

Products were stored in a NoSQL database, specifically DynamoDB, providing an efficient and scalable solution.

This architecture is particularly useful for small-scale serverless e-commerce projects. While I acknowledge that it's not groundbreaking, I take pride in what I've achieved in just one month of study and dedication.

**And that's the final result!**
